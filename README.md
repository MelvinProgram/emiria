## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text

src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── Header.astro
│   │   ├── Footer.astro
│   │   └── MainLayout.astro
│   │
│   ├── sections/
│   │   ├── SlideHero.astro
│   │   ├── Hero.astro
│   │   ├── Benefits.astro
│   │   ├── ForWho.astro
│   │   ├── Products.astro
│   │   ├── Ingredients.astro
│   │   ├── HowToUse.astro
│   │   ├── BeforeAfter.astro
│   │   ├── Reviews.astro
│   │   ├── Experts.astro
│   │   ├── FAQCurly.astro
│   │   ├── FounderHistory.astro
│   │   └── FinalCTA.astro
│
├── pages/
│   └── index.astro
│
├── styles/
│   └── global.css
│
└── data/
    ├── products.ts
    └── faqs.ts

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
